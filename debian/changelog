wmbattery (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * First release.
  .
  * Started with wmapm 1.2 sources. Gutted it and cleaned it up extensively
    and turned it into wmbattery.
  * Drew new faceplate and graphics.
  * Converted manpage to refer to new program name.
  * Reorganized source tree.
  * Split single xpm up into lots of small xpms, loaded seperately.
  * Cleaned up Makefile.
  * Removed README, TODO, INSTALL, etc; I'll write my own.
  * Parse command line with getopt.
  * Made -d work to set the display.
