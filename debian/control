Description: Display laptop battery info, dockable in WindowMaker
 Wmbattery displays the status of your laptop's battery in a small icon.
 This includes if it is plugged in, if the battery is charging, how many
 minutes of battery life remain, battery life remaining (with both a 
 percentage and a graph), and battery status (high - green, low - yellow, 
 or critical - red).
 .
 There's nothing in the program that makes it require WindowMaker, except
 maybe the look. It can be docked in WindowMaker or Afterstep's dock.
 .
 To use this program you need to enable APM support for your kernel during
 configuration; the corresponding questions are in the 'Character devices'
 section. It will only work on laptops with an APM BIOS.
