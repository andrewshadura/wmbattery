* The dial doesn't fill up/drain out very prettily. Add some code to special
  case things so it looks better.
* Can /proc/apm be kept open and rewound?
  - Yes, it can -- libapm.a does this. I could use it in linux, though it
    would increase executrable size some. Would be good though as I'd have
    less code to maintain.
* Make it load up the mask from file, not #include it.
* Allow user-settable colors, like asclock does.
* Allow the user to define when it should display different battery colors.
