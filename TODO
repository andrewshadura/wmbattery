* The dial doesn't fill up/drain out very prettily. Add some code to special
  case things so it looks better.
* Make it load up the mask from file, not #include it.
* Allow user-settable colors, like asclock does.
* Improve the battery lifetime estimation algo.
* Break the ACPI code out into a proper standalone library (already 2 other
  programs use it).
* Make -b 0 display an overall average of the status of all batteries,
  much like apm does on multi-battery laptops.
