Wmbattery displays the status of your laptop's battery in a small icon. This
includes if it is plugged in, if the battery is charging, how many minutes
of battery life remain, battery life remaining (with both a percentage and a
graph), and battery status (high - green, low - yellow, or critical - red).

Wmbattery is based heavily on wmapm by Chris D. Faulhaber <jedgar@speck.ml.org>
-- see the copyright file for more information.

Wmapm is a nice program - why have I modified it into wmbattery? Here are
some improvements in wmbattery:

  - Improved icon layout. I crammed the same information into less space
    while making the icon more elegant and visually pleasing (IMHO).
  - Easier to drag onto dock.
  - Displays 100% when your battery is full (wmapm is limited to 99% maximum).
  - It consumes a little less memory.
  - Uses only 8 colors.
  - You can run in on a different display via -d (broken in wmapm).

Conversely, here are some reasons to stick with wmapm:

  - It's a more mature program.
  - You like its look.
  - It has a neat rainbow-colored progress bar.
  - You need freebsd support (should be added to wmbattery eventually).
