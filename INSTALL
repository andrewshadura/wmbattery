Quickstart: run "make test" to compile and test the program.

To install, you should first edit the Makefile - pay special attention to
the setting for ICONDIR, this is a directory the icons used by this program
will go in and defaults to /usr/share/icons/wmbattery.

If the Makefile looks ok, install it like so:
	make
	make install

Note that you will need libxpm to build and use the program.
